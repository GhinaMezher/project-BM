<h1>Our research question</h1>
<section id="i.-the-importance-and-history-of-research-in-education" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-the-importance-and-history-of-research-in-education">I. The importance and history of research in education</h2>
<p>It is undeniable education profoundly shapes societal progress. From allowing humans to make world changing discoveries to multiplying the efficiency and use of physical capital; education lets each individual make use of their production power. Education is also considered a fundamental right, as it is stipulated in the universal declaration of Human Rights 1948, and a key element of development as seen in the 2000 MDGs (MDG n°2) and the 2015 SDGs (SDG n°4).</p>
<p>Today, economic research in education is considered a greatly developed field, highlighting the importance of public spending in education and the necessity for targeted funding and strategic policies. We owe the establishment of the field to the theory of human capital by Schultz, Becker and Mincer established in the 50’s . What started as a simple causality relationship between additional years of education and wage differences was frivolously applied to empirical studies, and econometric models. This allowed researchers to understand countries’ particular attributes and situations but also if lack of education should be considered a demand or a supply problem.</p>
<p>Investing in human capital, here in its educational form, is considered fundamental to the reduction of inequalities. Take for example woman’s fertility. Research has found that, in developing countries, one additional year of schooling reduces woman’s fertility rate by 10%, enabling a much needed demographic transition. This causality relationship can be explained by the increase of revenue on the labor market through additional years of schooling, allowing women to take on better jobs and increasing the opportunity cost of having a child.</p>

<section id="ii.-the-link-between-education-and-unemployment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-the-link-between-education-and-unemployment">II. The link between education and unemployment</h2>
<p>The polarization of the labor market has become a clear and urgent issue. The dreaded phenomenon represents, for the middle class, the end of social mobility. Polarization of the labor market defines the historical decline of the rate of jobs that lie in the middle of the distribution of qualification (France Stratégie 2020). The prosperity of machinery and innovation has led to the decrease of basic qualification demanding jobs in favor of highly qualified jobs or low qualified jobs. This phenomenon has revealed itself particularly challenging for under-qualified youth, whose unemployment rate has increased in the past few years.</p>
<p>In order to form the subject of our study we begun with the same idea as the theory of capital : how can altering the offer of education impacts individuals’ status on the labor market.</p>
<p>However, in a will to understand the role the government must play when it comes to the offer in education we may ask ourselves : Should government leaders expect their educational spending to impact the unemployment rate ?</p>
<p>A higher unemployment rate could also prompt governments to allocate more funds to education as a way to respond to the need for training to boost employability, we therefore see a potential double causality between educational spending and unemployment. The potential reciprocal influence between educational investments and workforce participation unveils a complex interplay, emphasizing the need for nuanced analysis to comprehend the multifaceted impact of education on labor markets.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this exploration aims to inform policy decisions, offering insights into the interwoven pathways that shape both educational outcomes and employment prospects, fostering more holistic approaches towards societal development.</p>
<p>All these elements lead us to ask the following question: How can public spending on education help reduce youth unemployment in the world?</p>
<p>To answer our question, we will first look at the general trends in public spending and youth unemployment since 1970. We will then show that education spending is essential to reducing youth unemployment. Finally, we’ll see that this is not enough, and that the reduction in the unemployment rate is made possible by other factors such as the country’s development, rigidity on the labor market, etc.</p>

<section id="data-set-description" class="level1">
<h1>Data set description</h1>
<p>Our topic of study in this project tackles the impact of education spending on the youth unemployment rate. For that, we have decided to take our databases from sites such as the World Bank and the International Labor Organization (ILO), as these are major global institutions known primarily for their availability and accessibility. For example, World Bank compiles and makes available a wide range of data on global economic development such as expenditures in school per country.</p>
<p>Thanks to the richness of information in our panel ILO data base and panel World Bank database we will be able to study the impact of public educational spending on the educational aspect of human capital. With the detailed information from various countries and on a big date range, we are able to study the impact on a micro and macro level. The micro impact can be observed by studying each country on its own and observing the variations throughout the years. This also makes comparing countries possible; we could therefore observe the impact on developing countries and developed countries. We can also compare the effects of education spending on the youth unemployment rate within countries, i.e.&nbsp;between men and women, and between countries, i.e.&nbsp;the macroeconomic impact of education spending.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight the real and empirical impact of the augmentation of educational spending on level of education thanks to the “classif2” variable now called “Education”. Through this potential correlation and causality we could understand the impact of a budgetary politic in education on unemployment. The underlying assumption is that a positive correlation between increased educational spending and higher education levels could translate into a subsequent decline in unemployment figures over the ensuing years. Therefore the project endeavors to decipher how these factors (public spending and education levels) interplay in the context of unemployment rates.</p>
<p>Our databases are dense, which requires delimiting our subject such as the period on which we are going to be studying or the variables that we consider to be most relevant.</p>
<section id="description-of-the-world-bank-database" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description-of-the-world-bank-database">Description of the World bank database</h2>
<p>First, many of the databases provided by the World Bank include time series data, allowing to analyze trends and changes over time. It could be essential for understanding the dynamics of variables. Then, the World Bank is known for maintaining high standards in databases. There is data reliability, World Bank data is generally subject to rigorous standards and quality controls. As part of our project, the database from the World Bank allows us to make international comparisons by collecting data from many countries, such as school expenditure for example.</p>
<p>Finally, by analyzing World Bank data on school expenditures, we can merge this database with the youth unemployment rate to study the correlation (or causality) of education spending on the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>It means that we could observe that the higher education spending led to a lower youth unemployment rate, or that the high youth unemployment rate can be explained by lower spending on education.</p>

<p>Then, the International Labor Organization (ILO) provides a wealth of data related to labor and employment. The ILO sets international standards for labor and labor statistics. These standards guarantee a consistent methodology for the collection and presentation of data on the labor market, including the unemployment rate.This site therefore corresponds perfectly to our project.</p>
<p>ILO data offers comprehensive insights into the global labor marker, especially unemployment in the world, and youth unemployment (15-29 years old). Like the World Bank, the ILO collects and compiles data on youth unemployment from a wide range of countries, allowing for international comparisons which is perfect for our project. Both sites making international comparisons, it allows for an interesting world level analysis of our subject of study.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-spending-on-education-since-2014-in-the-world">1) Public spending on education since 2014 in the world</h3>
<p>To begin our analysis, we’ll be looking at how public spending on education has evolved around the world. This will enable us to look at general trends, and to see which countries have the highest and lowest educational expenditure.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="Projet-BM_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Therefore we can see public spending varies through time with a particular low in 1996 and 1997. Over the past few years, the average public spending on education has hovered around 4.8% of GDP with a decline starting 2021; we might imagine a reorientation of public spending to other sectors like health, security and energy following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. It is therefore interesting to conduct a more in depth examination of public expenditure trends since 2014, in order to define which countries contribute to elevating this average and those that contribute to lowering it.</p>

</div>
<p>Thanks to this graph, we have the evolution of public spending on education over the period 2014-2022. The dots represent the countries, we can therefore see that the average public expenditure in 2021 is elevated by Kiribati and the Marshall Islands’ public spending on education. These two countries have also relatively high education spending in the 2014-2022 time span, also adding to that list Namibia and the Federated States of Micronesia. Therefore examining the influence of public spending on the youth unemployment rate in countries situated in Africa (for the case of Namibia) would be a compelling study taking into account that the MDGs and SDGs on education focused on development projects in the region.</p>

</section>
<section id="youth-unemployment-in-the-world" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="youth-unemployment-in-the-world">2) Youth unemployment in the world</h3>
<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at the evolution of the global youth unemployment rate over the period 2014-2022. Taking the same period as public spending will allow us to account for a potential correlation (or even causality) between public spending and the unemployment rate in a second part. Here, we analyze only the major trends to begin our study.</p>
<p>Unemployment refers to the deprivation of a job. An unemployed person is not deprived of work, but of employment. For the person who holds it, employment is a source of income through participation in the economic distribution of the wealth produced.</p>
<p>According to ILO, an unemployed person is a person aged 15 or over who simultaneously meets three conditions: being unemployed during a given week; being available to take up a job within two weeks; having actively looked for a job in the last four weeks or having found one starting in less than three months.</p>
<p>In the wake of worsening youth unemployment in Europe, a debate has recently emerged about the instrument used at the ILO: should rates or ratios be used to express youth unemployment?</p>
<p>The difference lies in the denominator: only the young workforce - those working or looking for work - is taken into account in the case of the rate, as opposed to the entire 15-24 age group - including full-time students - in the case of the ratio.</p>
<p>So, if we look at 200 young people, 100 of whom are students and 50 employed, the unemployment rate is 50 percent, while the ratio is 25 percent.</p>
<p>Applying a ratio can be useful for comparing levels of youth unemployment between countries, because there are significant differences in the way countries count youth participation in the workforce. In the case of ILO database we have a unemployment rate which enables us to compare countries in our database.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="Projet-BM_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can see that the global youth unemployment rate has been rising for several decades with a decrease since 2020, focusing on that time frame allows us to understand if this decrease is led by an increase in public spending in education.</p>

<p>Through this graph we can see countries with highest youth unemployment rate at the top of the line. They are Kosovo, South Africa, Uruguay,Tuvalu and Greece. They do not appear as countries who spend the lowest % of GDP on education, it is therefore interesting to conduct a study on African countries in order to understand the potential causality or non-causality between public expenditure and youth unemployment.</p>

<p>Having seen which countries devote the most or least of their GDP to education spending, we’re now going to look at which countries have the highest and lowest unemployment rates among young people, in this case 15-24 year-old.</p>

<p>We can see from this graph that the place where youth unemployment is highest is predominantly in Africa. Public spending can therefore have an impact on the youth unemployment rate. But we can also see that some African countries have the lowest unemployment rates, so education spending isn’t the only explanatory variable.</p>

<p>In order to have a more in depth analysis of general trends and understand the different impact of public expenditure on sexes, age groups and level of education we must select one year to study out of our panel data. The code becomes quite simple to alter in order to study another date by replacing the year 2021 that we have chosen with whichever year is of interest to the researcher.</p>
<p>We have chosen the year 2021 as it is the year where public expenditure and youth unemployment started to recede. As we have only observed world averages it would be interesting to have a more in depth look at some countries to better understand these trends and how they apply to different categories and regions. Add onto that the high public spending of some countries that year, we will be able to observe their impact on youth unemployment according to sex and level of education.</p>

<p>We can therefore see a small disparity in the distribution of points between the subplots of each of these two graphs. When it comes to the genders, women tend to have a higher youth unemployment rate than men for the same public spending in % of GDP. When it comes to level of education, for the same amount of public spending in education, the youth unemployment rate tends to be higher for a level of education stated as “Basic” than “Advanced”. More education seems to be a good way to reduce unemployment. Public spending can therefore be a useful tool to push students to achieve an advanced level of education, reducing the unemployment rate the year they enter the labor market.</p>
<p>Take for example countries with high public spending. They tend to have an overall lower youth unemployment rate (especially for an advanced level of education) might it be for the different sexes or level of education. The disparity in youth unemployment between men and women and different levels of education is less prominent for countries with higher public spending.</p>
<p>The graphs remain quite hard to read as each point represents one country for one age range, it is therefore interesting to take on the analysis of certain representative countries for each of our later sections to better see how public spending in education impacts men and women differently.</p>

<p>This general observation allows us to take into account the impact of public spending on education by Age groups and by level of education, for the year 2021.</p>
<p>Generally, a higher public spending rate allows for lower youth unemployment on all age ranges. For a relatively high public spending (around 7%) we can see an “Advanced” red dot with a 100% youth unemployment rate. This could be due to the use of the ratio of youth unemployment counting students as unemployed. For this specific case, the 100% unemployment ratio might be led by a large part of 15-19 years pursuing higher education thanks to good public expenditure.</p>
<p>In order to read this graph we could take a look at a specific value of Public Spending, for example 7.8% of GDP. This is considered a high public spending in education. We can therefore see which levels of education are benefiting from this public expenditure. We can see that for such a public spending and for the different age ranges, advanced level of education tends to have a lower youth unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Public spending therefore impacts individuals differently and according to their level of education. An individual that has an intermediate level at 15-19 and gets on the labor market will not benefit from the public expenditure. This is why for countries with higher public spending we can see the points tend to stay lower as public expenditure promotes and helps individuals stay in the school system.</p>

<p>Here we divided our observations into 2 sections thanks to the creation of a High/Low dummy variable. Countries with “High” public spending in education have a % of GDP dedicated to education superior to the mean of our database. Here we can see that as youth unemployment rises, the count of countries with a high public spending decreases becoming smaller than the red bars that represent “Low” spending in education.</p>

<p>Counter-intuitively, developed countries do not allocate the highest % of GDP to public spending on education.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, there has been a general decline trend in education spending in the G8 countries. This decline can be explained by the aging of the population, leading to a reallocation of public spending to health. Another factor may be government priorities. The sudden increase in 1993 can be explained by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, which reduced trade between countries and hence GDP. As education spending remained unchanged, its share of GDP increased. In 2020, the decline in the share of education spending fell sharply as a result of the health crisis, which reduced both GDP and education spending.</p>
<p>Moreover, this graph plots the average for G8 countries without taking into account the disparities between them, as we shall see in the following graph.</p>

<p>Focusing solely on the G8 countries, we have assigned a color to each country, showing that the United States (pink), France (yellow) and Great Britain (green) are the countries that spend the most on education. We can see that USA’s public spending remains around 5,5% of the GDP compared to Italy with 4,1 of GDP. So, if we take the general trend into account, we can see that for the selected countries we have a drop in public spending on education. Moreover, we don’t have any information about public spending on education in Russia for 2021 and 2022.</p>

<p>In comparison with the graph showing the evolution of the share of public expenditure in GDP for the G8 countries (Figure 10), we still observe disparities between countries, that are even more pronounced for African countries going up to nearly 8 percentage points difference (Namibia vs Madagascar). The disparity is even more pronounced with Namibia’s higher than 8% of GDP public spending in education.</p>

<p>Youth unemployment in Africa is higher than in the rest of the world, with a notable resurge since 2020. That may be caused by the current dept problems African countries have faced that have only worsened with the COVID-19 crisis. Dept problems allow for budget constraints as the government is focused on reducing their dept. This may lead to a reduction of public spending in education (not very observable in the previous graph because of missing values) and lead to higher unemployment. This will be latered studied though regression tests.</p>

<p>Once again, we observe a great disparity in youth unemployment between the countries we have observed. We can see that Malawi has a very low unemployment rates, without having a particularly high public expenditure (cf.&nbsp;figure 13). Public spending therefore impacts these countries very differently depending on the institutions and policies established.</p>

<p>In this graph we can see that, in the case of African countries, advanced level of education still lead to high unemployment rate even when public spending in education hovers around 6-7% of GDP. This is still true for higher age ranges such as 25-29. This matter worsens in the case of low public expenditure. We have taken for example a public spendinf og 7.8% of GDP (red vertical line) where we can observe high unemployment rates for teh 20-24 and 24-29 age ranges. This might be understood by an inefficiency of public spending that we will test with a linear regression.</p>

<h1>Statistical test, linear regression, instrumental variables</h1>
<p>The second part being a more descriptive part highlighting the major trends in the world and in specific geographical areas, such as Africa in our case. In this last part of our project we will look carefully at the different links that education spending and the youth unemployment rate have between them. For this we will carry out statistical tests such as the chi-square law, linear regressions.</p>
<p>Instrumental variables are used to solve the endogeneity problem in econometric models. We want to run a linear regression looking at the impact of education spending on the youth unemployment rate. In our project, we will use education expenditure as the explanatory variable and the youth unemployment rate as the explained variable.</p>
<p>To deepen our analysis, we will use instrumental variables, which are variables used to solve the endogeneity problem in econometric models. Endogeneity can arise when the explanatory variable is correlated with model errors, which can bias estimation results. Instrumental variables are therefore used to isolate the uncorrelated variation of the explanatory variable and use it as a proxy for that variable.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this project, we can therefore use the following instrumental variables: total government expenditure, number of schools per capita and population growth rate. This allows us to see whether these variables are not correlated directly with the youth unemployment rate, but are correlated directly with education spending.</p>

<p>The correlation test provides valuable insights into the strength and direction of the linear relationship between public spending on education and the youth unemployment rate. The correlation coefficient and p-value help us assess the statistical significance of the observed correlation. In this case, with a negative correlation coefficient between public spending (% of GDP) and youth unemployment (%), this suggests that there could be a trend where higher levels of public spending are associated with lower rates of youth unemployment, and vice versa.</p>

<p>When we take all African countries together, we can see a different correlation to the one previously calculated. In fact, it’s positive, suggesting that the higher the public spending, the higher the youth unemployment rate.</p>
<p>This clearly validates our previous observation concerning African countries, and might be due to corruption or inefficient policies (typically dealing with lack of efficiency as a demand problem instead of a supply/quality problem).</p>

<p>After adding the Education and sex control variables we can see public spending still has a negative impact on youth unemployment. Education is therefore not the only factor of unemployment and public expenditure has a direct impact on youth unemployment on the labor market.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Throughout our study we have observed general and more particular trends in public spending in education and youth unemployment around the world. By focusing on the G8 countries and African countries, and conduction linear regressions and correlations trends we were able to understand the various impacts of public spending on unemployment.</p>
<p>When it comes to the G8 countries, public spending has a negative impact on youth unemployment highlighting the need to tackle issues on the labor market through an educational approach. For the same amount of public spending youth unemployment is higher for women. However the difference between men and women decreases for higher public spending making it a good approach to reducing inequalities on the labor market. For different age groups and level of education, young people with low education levels tend to have a high unemployment ratio as they may still be in school. However, unemployment strongly decreases in higher age ranges and for higher education levels. Public spending in education can therefore tackle unemployment issues by allowing students to pursue higher degrees allowing them to easily find jobs on the labor market.</p>
<p>When it comes to the African countries, public spending has a chocking positive impact on youth unemployment highlighting. This perfectly represents the lack of efficiency of public spending when it isn’t coupled with sufficient public policies and control. For the same amount of public spending youth unemployment is higher for women.Contrary to G8 countries, this difference does not decrease with the increase of public spending. There are still discrimination issues to be tackled on the labor market through other policy tools. Unemployment is till quite high even for advanced level of education and older age ranges, even for high pubic spending, this only accentuates the inefficiency of public spending when it is not well implemented.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study underscores the strong disparities in the impact of public spending in education on youth unemployment between G8 countries and African nations, emphasizing the critical need for tailored policy interventions to address these global differences. Our analysis therefore advocates for a nuanced understanding of the relationship between public spending and youth unemployment, urging policymakers to elaborate targeted approaches to optimize the impact of public funds on labor market dynamics.</p>
